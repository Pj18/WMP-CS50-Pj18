1.  it's a header file in c introduced in 1999 to write code in more portable way.
2.  uint8_t=unsigned int of 8 bits.
    uint32_t=unsigned int of 32 bits.
    int32_t=signed int of 32 bits.
    uint16_t=unsigned in of 16 bits.
3.  BYTE=1 byte
    DWORD=4 byte
    LONG=4 byte
    WORD=2 byte
4.  Hex:    0x424d
    ASCII:  BM (bitmap!)
    Decimal:    16973
5.  bfSize
    The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    biSize
    The number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If it can't find the file, it will.

9.  Because it specifies how many elements you want to read, and we're always
    reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.

10. 3
11. moves to specific location in a file.
12. whodunit.
